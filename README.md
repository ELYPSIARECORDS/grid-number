grid = GRid.parse("  grid:A1-2425G-ABC1234011-K  ")
grid.valid?          # true
grid.id_scheme       # A1
grid.issuer_code     # 2425G

grid.check_character # K

grid = GRid.new(:issuer_code => "2425G", :release_number => "ABC1234002")
grid.check_character # M

grid.check_character # 3

grid = GRid.parse("A12425GABC1234011X") # Wrong check character
grid.valid?                   # false
grid.errors[:check_character] # ["verification failed"]
